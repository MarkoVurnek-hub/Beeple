                Beeple sold an NFT for $69 million
              </h2>
              <p>
                Until October, the most Mike Winkelmann — the digital artist
                known as Beeple — had ever sold a print for was $100. Today, an
                NFT of his work sold for $69 million at Christie’s. The sale
                positions him “among the top three most valuable living
                artists,” according to the auction house.

                It’s good news for crypto-optimists, but what about for art?

                "I honestly, like, I never thought I could sell my work," Beeple
                said in an interview at his home in South Carolina. "Kind of
                late September, early October, people kept hitting me on being
                like, 'Oh, you got to look at this NFT thing.'"

                Mike Winkelmann is an American graphic designer. In May 2007 he

                nickname for his uncle) and shared it online. The next day he
                made another image and once again posted it online. He did the

                When digital artist Beeple put an NFT digital artwork up for

                almost $70 million. The record sale also sparked huge interest
                in digital certificates of authenticity based on cryptocurrency
                technology that are called “non-fungible tokens.”
